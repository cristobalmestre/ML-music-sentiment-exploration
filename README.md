# ðŸŽµ Lyrics Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the **sentiment analysis of song lyrics**, leveraging data from **Genius API** and **Spotify's sentiment data**. The goal is to analyze how song lyrics correlate with their emotional tone as inferred from Spotify's metadata. 

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Lyrics Extraction**: Fetches song lyrics using the Genius API.
- **Spotify Sentiment Data**: Incorporates Spotify's sentiment-related features.
- **Data Parsing & Processing**: Cleans and structures lyrics for sentiment analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis Techniques**: Applies different methodologies to analyze the emotions conveyed in lyrics.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implements machine learning models such as **DAN with GloVe embeddings** and **BERT**.

## ðŸ“œ How It Works
1. **Lyrics Collection**
   - Uses the **Genius API** to search for songs and extract lyrics.
   - Handles missing data by retrying and logging failed attempts.

2. **Spotify Sentiment Data Integration**
   - Pulls **song-level metadata** (e.g., valence, energy) from Spotify.
   - Maps these attributes to corresponding lyrics for sentiment analysis.

3. **Lyrics Processing & Sentiment Analysis**
   - Cleans and structures the lyrics data.
   - Applies **text-based sentiment analysis** using techniques such as:
     - Natural Language Processing (NLP) sentiment scoring
     - Lexicon-based sentiment comparison
     - Machine learning models (DAN with GloVe, BERT)

## ðŸ”§ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually: `pip install lyricsgenius rauth pandas requests beautifulsoup4 torch transformers`)*

## ðŸ›  Usage
- Run **`Install Lyric Genius.py`** to set up API dependencies.
- Use **`Genius_path_for_lyrics_pandas.py`** to fetch song lyrics from the Genius API.
- Execute **`parsing_lyrics_pandas.py`** to clean and structure lyrics.
- Experiment with different sentiment models in the `notebooks/` directory:
  - **DAN with GloVe embeddings** for sentiment prediction.
  - **BERT-based models** for deep learning sentiment analysis.
