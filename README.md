This is an exploration to understand sentiment of songs based on their lyrics.
The project contemplated scraping and dowloading lyrics from the Genuis website, using their API, parsing them and then using several techniques to compare their performance.
Each Jupyter Notebook file contains a Model approximation to discover sentiment. Information from Spotify was used to asses correctness of the sentiment.
